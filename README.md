**`Future programmer `**

I am currently studying information and communication technologies at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.

School projects I've been part of:

### Web Programming Application Project, MovieSite:
In this course we learned how to use React for frontend, Javascript for backend and PostgreSQL for database.
The site shows movie reviews that users can write themselves if like or dislike and users can also form groups.

### Mobile Application Project, Healthapp

For this project, we developed a React Native application called HealthApp. 
The app allows users to efficiently track their workouts and monitor their calorie intake. 
To ensure seamless data storage and retrieval, all user data is securely stored in a Firestore database.

### Product Design and Impementation

For this project course, we had the freedom to choose our topic, and we decided to create a 2D roguelike game using Unity.
The game features procedurally generated levels, offering a unique experience each time. 
Players can collect random weapons and hats to aid them in battling enemies.
